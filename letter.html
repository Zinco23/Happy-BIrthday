I hope you're doing well po. i guess I should move or out for this so the sharp thing that always fk me up will stop well you know po Friday 10:45pm I found out wala na atoang affinity Saturday 1:15am dili nata friend sa fb then wala kow ma accept sa fb, at first I thought wala ra but then I realized that its on purpose so I understand. I checked my Insta and found out that we're not friend right there anymore but its okay it doesn't matter I understand u po sakit sya but yk taw raman ta we hurt and we heal ra pud HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

If ure in the difficult days God is there just pray for it po sorry gyud po pero murag like need ranako ig thats the other part that will lead me to fix myself and become better I wish you will success on everything ur goals and dreams.

sorry gyud po its like tuff gyud nako para maka heal bc whenever i talk with u the pain is still there and my mood starts to crashed out and turning myself into nothing well Im really lucky that i met u who will expect diay nga tungod sa blind date na abot ta sa in ani right? HAHAHAHAHA well God has a plan for us so he separated us and one day the time is right maybe we can get back as a couple. for now, I need some rest na Im tired of thinking nga wala naka even tho I alr accepted and ig this decision will be right for me so I can getover for our rs.

I hope u can forgive me. I didn't even expect that this will be the outcome but still I have to accept it, I respect your decision bc we cant fight for it bc we're too young paman sad gyud the time isn't for us pa HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA all I can do now is to focus on my goals pud and my dreams as well as my ambitions my passion. maybe it can be better for me sad.
